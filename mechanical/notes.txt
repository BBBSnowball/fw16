Adjust 3D design to active area of epaper:
- Pixel pitch is 0.169 mm, according to
  https://files.waveshare.com/upload/7/71/3.7inch_e-Paper_Specification.pdf
- (That matches the active area when multiplied by 480 and 280. Good.)
- Use test2.png:
  - leftmost column is visible but barely
  - top is visible and has a gap of maybe 5 px
  - 11 rows are hidden at the bottom
  - 1.5 rows are hidden at the right
- Let's aim for a gap of 2 px, i.e. 0.34 mm.
- Adjust (positive is towards the middle):
  left: -0.15 mm
  top: +0.5 mm -> +0.3 mm
  right: -0.6 mm
  bottom: -2.2 mm -> -1.2 mm

  Left and right are swapped when looking at the sketch!
